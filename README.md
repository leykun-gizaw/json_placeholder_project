# {JSON} Placeholder Locally With React

Just a simple project that uses a local JSON data and server to host as REST API and consume it with a react application.

Project was scaffolded with Vite

## Usage

If you want to try this locally follow these steps: -

- Install all `npm` packages.

```bash
    npm i
```

- Within the repo the folder `dummy-json` holds all the dummy data.
    - The base data is from [{JSON}Placeholder](https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com)
    - To use `json-server` to serve it use the following command
```bash
    npm run local-server
```
- Then to run the main react application run the following
```bash
    npm run dev
```
***That's it for now***
